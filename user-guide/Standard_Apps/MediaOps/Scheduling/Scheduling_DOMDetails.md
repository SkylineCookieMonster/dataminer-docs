# Resource scheduling DOM

## Overview

See also: [Job lifecycle](xref:scheduling_job_lifecycle)

## DOM model

Resource scheduling and workflow both share the core DOM module: *(slc)workflow*.

### Jobs DOM definition

The module *(slc)workflow* contains the DOM definitions for a **Job**.

A Job is the main way a user can add a reservation for a resource or group of resources. It has a variety of sections that include basic information about when the Job starts and stops, who the Job is for, what resources are booked, etc.
