# Scheduling - Ops Board

## Overview

The Operations Board, also known as the Ops Board, has been crafted with operators in mind. It serves as a centralized hub, enabling operators to effortlessly track upcoming, active, and completed tasks, even amidst the hustle and bustle of busy control rooms. Moreover, equipped with intuitive tools, it empowers operators to swiftly locate and adjust any jobs requiring attention, thereby minimizing errors and ensuring seamless operations.

## Execution State Filtering

With a simple click, Operators can effortlessly configure the page to display Jobs based on their current status: Active, Upcoming, or Recently Completed.

- **Upcoming Jobs**: These are tasks scheduled to commence shortly. Having them readily visible enables operators to prioritize their efforts effectively, focusing on imminent tasks.
- **Active Jobs**: This category encompasses tasks that have begun but are still within their scheduled timeframe.
- **Completed Jobs**: These are tasks that have recently concluded. It's essential to have quick access to these for follow-up and review purposes.
- Lastly, the **All** option consolidates all three statuses into a single view, providing a comprehensive overview of the operational landscape.

## Action Status

The Action Status filtering feature enables users to easily identify and manage jobs that are not fully configured. By applying this filter, users can swiftly pinpoint tasks that require further attention or completion, ensuring that all necessary configurations are in place before proceeding. This functionality streamlines the workflow, reducing the risk of oversights and enhancing overall efficiency in job management.

## Job Type Filtering

Jobs can be generated in two distinct ways: either by scheduling activities during resource reservation for future use or by routing [Virtual Signal Groups](xref:virtual_signal_groups_app) using the [Control Surface](xref:control_surface_app) application. By default, the Ops Board automatically filters out ad-hoc Jobs, which are typically long-term bookings, to prevent clutter on the operator's screen. However, operators have the flexibility to adjust the filtering options, choosing to display only Scheduled Jobs, only Ad-Hoc Jobs, or all Jobs as needed to suit their operational requirements.

## Job Actions

The Jobs table includes built in tools allowing the user fast and convenient access to the common actions they need to process work. Each Job displays quick action buttons to Edit or Duplicate a Job. Additionally, depending on the state of the Job, users might also be presented with additional options to Start or Stop a Job early as needed.
