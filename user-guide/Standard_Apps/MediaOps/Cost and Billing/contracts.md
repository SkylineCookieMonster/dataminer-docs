# Contracts

Contracts play a crucial role in managing financial aspects within our application. Let's delve into the key components of contracts:

1. **Validity Period**: Contracts have a defined validity period with a start and end time. This ensures that the terms and conditions apply only during the specified timeframe.

1. **Discount**: Contracts can include discounts that are applied when calculating the bill.

1. **Uplift**: Contracts can include an uplift that is applied when calculating the bill. This will increase the total amount to the specified uplift percentage.

1. **Speed Order Fees**: Contracts may have zero, one, or more Speed Order Fees. These fees are applied based on how quickly a job starts after its booking confirmation. Speed Order Fees can be fixed amounts or incremental charges added to the total billing price.

1. **Cancellation Fees**: Similar to Speed Order Fees, contracts can also have zero, one, or more Cancellation Fees. These fees come into play if a job is canceled. Like Speed Order Fees, Cancellation Fees can be fixed or incremental.

1. **Billing Type**: Determines how to charge the jobs associated to this contract. The Billing Type can be Workflow base, Resource based or Workflow+Resource based:

    * Workflow - Charges the job based on its Workflow. Billing calculation will not take job nodes into account.
    * Resource - Charges the job based on its Nodes. Billing calculation will not take the job's workflow into account.
    * Workflow+Resource - Charges the job based on its Workflow and Nodes.

1. **Default Ratecards**: Specify ratecards to be used when no ratecard was assigned to individual workflows or resources.

    * Default Workflow Ratecard - Ratecard used by default to charge the job's workflow. If the contract doesn't specify a ratecard to a particular workflow, this is the ratecard that will be used instead.
    * Default Resource Ratecard - Ratecard used by default to charge the job's nodes. If the contract doesn't specify a ratecard to a particular resource or resource pool, this is the ratecard that will be used instead.

1. **Workflow Specific Billing Ratecards**: Assgin a ratecard to an individual Workflow

    * Ratecard - The ratecard to assign to an individual workflow.
    * Workflow - The specific workflow to be assigned the ratecard.

1. **Pool Specific Billing Ratecards**: Assgin a ratecard to an individual Resource Pool

    * Ratecard - The ratecard to assign to an individual resource pool.
    * Workflow - The specific resource pool to be assigned the ratecard.

1. **Resource Specific Billing Ratecards**: Assgin a ratecard to an individual Resource

    * Ratecard - The ratecard to assign to an individual resource.
    * Workflow - The specific resource to be assigned the ratecard.
